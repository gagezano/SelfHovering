# Carousel with Sets

This example preserves the carousel + details structure from the Arc campus section while swapping the building-specific information for placeholder "Set" labels and descriptions. The styling stays neutral and Helvetica-based.

- The carousel uses three slides with simple gradients.
- The controls update the active slide and text block.
- The right column mirrors the building info layout but describes generic concepts.

Open `index.html` to experiment with the carousel.
